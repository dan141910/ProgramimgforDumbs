			<h2>determining your layout scheme</h2>
			<p>
				All these layout options might just make your head spin. What’s the right
strategy? Well, that depends.
The most important thing is to find a technique you’re comfortable with that
gives you all the flexibility you need.
Floating layouts are generally your best bet, but it’s good to know how absolute positioning works. Every once in a while, you find a situation where
absolute positioning is a good idea, but generally it’s more difficult to pull off
than the floating mechanism.
Absolute positioning seems very attractive at first because it promises so
much control. The truth is, it’s pretty complicated to pull off well, it isn’t
quite as flexible as the floating layout techniques, and it’s hard to make it
work right in older browsers.
Sometimes, fixed and relative positioning schemes are handy, as in the example introduced in the fixed menu example described in this chapter.
The flexbox approach seems very promising, but it’s currently tedious to
write as you’ll need to repeat your code for all the browser prefixes. When it
can be used without prefixes, it will probably become the dominant scheme.
Sometimes, you’ll find it’s best to combine schemes. (It’s difficult to combine
absolute positioning with another scheme, but you can safely combine floating, fixed, and relative positioning techniques most of the time.)
The main point is to understand the various options available to you so you
can make a good choice for whatever project you’re currently working on.
