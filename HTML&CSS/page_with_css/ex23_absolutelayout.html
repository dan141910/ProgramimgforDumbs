				<h2>tip</h2>
				<p>You’re committed to position everything. After you start using absolute
positioning, you need to use it throughout your site. All the main page
elements require absolute positioning because the normal flow mechanism is no longer in place.
 You can still use floating layout inside an element with absolute position,
but all your main elements (heading, columns, and footing) need to have
absolute position if one of them does.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="content">
				<ol>
					<li>Plan the site. ->draw</li></li>
					<li>Specify an overall size. #all 
						This particular type of layout has a fixed size. Create an all div housing
all the other elements and specify the size of this div
					</li>
					<li>Create the HTML.</li>
					<li>Build a CSS style sheet.</li>
					<li>Identify each element</li>
					<li>Make each element absolutely positioned.:
						Set position: absolute in the CSS for each element in the layout.
					</li>
					<li>Specify the size of each element.
						Set the height and width of each element according to your diagram
					</li>
					<li>Determine the position of each element.
						Use the left and top attributes to determine where each element goes in the layout.
					</li>
					<li>Tune-up your layout.
						You’ll probably want to adjust margins and borders. You may need to do
						some adjustments to make it all work. For example, the menu is 150px
						wide, but I added padding-left and padding-right of 5px each.
						This means the width of the menu needs to be adjusted to 140px to
						make everything still fit. (width is attributes of content part)
