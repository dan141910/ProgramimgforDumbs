		<div id = "menu">
			<h2>Menu</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href = "#alpha">Alpha</a></li>

			<h2>Alpha</h2>
			<p>The HTML has only a few noteworthy characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It has a menu. The div named menu contains a list of links (like most menus).</li>
				<li>The menu has internal links. : gamma button 
					<p>The [a href= “#alpha”] Alpha ] code means create a link to the element in this page with the ID alpha.</p>
				</li>
				<li>The page has a series of content divs
					<p> Most of the page’s content
						appears in one of the several divs with the content class. This class
						indicates all these divs will share some formatting</p>
				</li>
				<li>The content divs have separate IDs. </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class = "content" id = "beta">
			<h2>Beta</h2>
			<p>
			Most of the CSS is familiar if you’ve looked over the other chapters in this
			minibook. I changed the menu list to make it look like a set of buttons, and
			I added some basic formatting to the headings and borders. The interesting
			thing here is how I positioned various elements.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "content" id = "gamma">
			<h2>Gamma</h2>
			<p>here is how to buiding a fixed menu</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1. Set the menu position to fixed by setting the position attribute to fixed.</li>
				<li>2. Give the menu a width with the width attribute.</li>
				<li>3.Consider the menu position by explicitly setting the top and left attributes.</li>
				<li>4. Set content position to relative.</li>
				<li>5. Change content’s left attribute to 20 percent.(100-menu)</li>
				<li>6.Give content a width property.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class = "content" id = "delta">
			<h2>Delta</h2>
			<p>In reality, I rarely use absolute positioning for page layout. It’s just too difficult to get working and too inflexible for the range of modern browsers.
			However, it is still used in certain specialty situations like web game development where the programmer is deliberately subverting normal layout
			schemes for more control of the visual interface</p>
